# Design Patterns in PHP
This tutorial is to help anyone starting to learn about design pattern, implemented in PHP

## [Creational Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns):
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### [1 - Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method):
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### [2 - Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory):
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### [3 - Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder):
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### [4 - Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### [5 - Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## [Structural Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns)
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### [1 - Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter):
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### [2 - Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
