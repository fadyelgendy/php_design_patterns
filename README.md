# Design Patterns in PHP
This tutorial is to help anyone starting to learn about design pattern, implemented in PHP

## [Creational Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns):
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### [1 - Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method):
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### [2 - Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory):
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### [3 - Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder):
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### [4 - Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
